      "A controversial decision to shut down a small sweet shop stall in a Teesside hospital has sparked outrage.\n",
      "A vintage cart that has been selling traditional sweets to those who use North Tees University Hospital has been ordered to close and its contract will end at the end of this month.\n",
      "It is understood the sweet stall owner received notice at the end of November that they would no longer be allowed to trade due to a nationwide NHS bid to promote healthy eating.\n",
      "Despite the small businesses being ordered to stop trading, Costa and other larger shops that also sell sugary drinks and food in the hospital may be allowed to continue to trade.\n",
      "Deepak Dwarakanath, medical director at North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust, said: “As part of a national campaign to promote healthy eating for NHS staff, visitors and patients, we decided to give notice to the sweets and cakes businesses in our hospital market stall areas.\n",
      "Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n",
      "“All contracts for these businesses will expire by the end of the year. This is part of wider and longer term plans to reduce the sale of sugary drinks and food across our hospital buildings.\n",
      "“Like NHS trusts across the country, we feel it’s important to send a strong message about the links between sugar and health issues like obesity and diabetes.”\n",
      "The news caused a backlash on social media with many hitting out at the nationwide campaign.\n",
      "One woman, who works at the hospital, said: “As a member of staff at North Tees I will miss popping out to the sweet cart for a little treat on my break.\n",
      "“Surely as adults we can choose for ourselves what we eat. Are Costa going to stop serving muffins and hot chocolate? Will the canteen stop selling chips? Doubt it.\n",
      "“Such a shame for these businesses too, the sweet stall guy is lovely!”\n",
      "Another woman said: “I am old enough to decide what I eat. Very sad that a small business can’t not be supported. I hope the staff canteen will also be made to follow the rules.”\n",
      "One user wrote: “They’re getting rid of the only thing that cheers me up when I have to go to hospital. Maybe they should focus more on the food they feed the patients. Pasties and pies are hardly going to help with their health.”\n",
      "One woman called the decision to shut the business down “stupid”, she said: “Never heard anything so stupid in all my life! Putting a business out on their ear they ought to be ashamed of themselves!”\n",

      "According to Closer magazine, the former EastEnders star wants to ease all tension between the pair for the sake of their unborn child - after Dan claimed the couple were no longer making each other happy.\n",
      "The insider said: 'Jacqueline is confused about why Dan would speak out like this and not talk things through with her first. But she still loves him and is about to have another child, so the last thing she wants is for things to be acrimonious.'\n",
      "While she was hurt by his comments, Jacqueline is hoping the arrival of their second child will bring the pair closer once again.\n",

      "Reconciling? The former EastEnders star reportedly wants to ease tension between the pair for the sake of their unborn child - after Dan claimed they no longer made each other happy\n",
      "The source added: 'She knows they're both hurting and angry, but she hopes once the baby arrives it'll give them more of a reason to fight for their relationship.\n",
      "'Jacqueline's a strong, proud person and she's not afraid of being a single mum, but that isn't what she wants. She thinks they need to take their time, but is hopeful they can be a family again.'\n",
      "Rumours of a split first surfaced in April - with Dan claiming there were issues in their marriage only a month later.\n",
      "Working it out: A source revealed that the actress, who is expecting her second child with Dan, still loves him despite the 'confusing' comments\n",

      "Take it slow: 'Jacqueline's a strong, proud person and she's not afraid of being a single mum, but that isn't what she wants. She thinks they need to take their time'\n",
      "The former TOWIE star told The Daily Star Sunday of their situation: 'I'm still staying with a mate. I left because we were arguing and it is such a waste of energy.\n",
      "'I still obviously care for Jacqueline but if we can't make each other happy then we shouldn't stay together. Life is too short.'\n",
      "Acknowledging that it had been a 'tough time' for the pair, Dan also admitted they had been arguing for a long time at home, leading him to go out with friends in order to enjoy himself rather than be unhappy at home.\n",
      "The star added he will move back home before the birth to be with Jacqueline and the couple's daughter Ella, three, but says he is unsure if the married couple will reconcile.\n",
      "He said: 'I will move back to help before the birth and with the baby, but I don't know after that. The main priority is the kids.'\n",
      "Chatting away: Jacqueline and Dan were seen having a private conversation in the stands\n",
